# plant_nutrient_detection
A Python-based machine learning project for detecting nutrient deficiencies in plant leaves using deep learning and computer vision.  This repository contains the training and inference code for building a model that analyzes leaf images and predicts nutrient deficiencies in plants, helping farmers detect nutritional stress early and effectively.
